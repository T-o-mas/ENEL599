# ENEL599
For centrifugal pump development of control system and sensor data acquistion
Scripts of interest:
- FinalScripts/Control-With-Sensors.py
- FinalScripts/AllSensors.ino

To run scripts with centrifugal pump
- Need to program arduino with AllSensors.ino
- Need to run Control-With-Sensors.py on RaspberryPi that is connected to programmed Arduino

Results are logged in a CSV file located in FinalScripts/outputs-flow-pressure directory. Results are organized in folders named by date and time of operation.
